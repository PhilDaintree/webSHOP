23/4/14 Added new includes/config.php options for ShopName, ShopDebtorNo and ShopBranchCode these settings in config.php over-ride the webERP shop config settings. This allows multiple webSHOP installations on the same webERP installation. However, the About Us, Terms and Conditions, FreightPolicy ContactUs pages are still configured in webERP and will be the same accross all webSHOPs off the same webERP installation

25/9/13 Ricard reported that discount was being applied twice - webERP recalculates discount matrix discount rate but webSHOP was sending net price with the order and then the discount matrix rate was recalcuated applying the discount twice. Now webSHOP creates the order with the gross price and the discount percent so the webSHOP order is the same when it displays in webERP.
